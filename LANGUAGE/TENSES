PRESENT SIMPLE

FORM : SUBJECT + VERB ( V1 / PRESENT )

If the SUBJECT is I/WE/YOU/THEY , we use the VERB w/o the "s" . For example ,

                        -----

If the SUBJECT is HE/SHE/IT , we use the VERB with "s". For example ,
                      She drinks coffee every morning.
                          ------

PAST SIMPLE
-----------

FORM : SUBJECT + VERB ( V2 / PAST )

For most of the VERBS , we make their past form by adding "-ed" . For example ,
                        played
                        receieved
                        lived
But for some of the VERBS , we don't have any rules to make their past forms. For example ,
                    give  -> {gave}  -> given
                    build -> {built} -> built
                    come  -> {came}  -> come
                    eat   -> {ate}   -> eaten
                    go    -> {went}  -> gone
These are called IRREGULAR VERBS.

USEAGE:

  1) Completed actions in the past
      - I {played} soccer with my friendslast Saturday.
      - Karen {gave} us a present for our wedding anniversary.
      - We {received} the package this morning.
      - My grandfather {built} this house in 1968.
      - Antonio {lived} in Malaysia for five years.
