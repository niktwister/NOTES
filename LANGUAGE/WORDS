THE HISTORY OF LEFT HAND VS RIGHT HAND
--------------------------------------
            The LATIN ROOT for right hand is DEXTER , while LATIN ROOT for left hand is SINISTER.
Historically  speaking the  "right handed person"  has always been considered more skilful , thus 
leading to words like :
            WORD            : dexterous
            BREAKDOWN       : dexter (LATIN ROOT) 
            PART OF SPEECH  : ADJECTIVE
            MEANING         : A person who is quite skilful (especially with their hands).

            WORD            : dexterity
            BREAKDOWN       : dexter (LATIN ROOT)
            PART OF SPEECH  : NOUN
            MEANING         : When we talk about dexterity of a person , we are talking about their
                              skills with hands.
            SENTENCE        : The dexterity of this pianist is impressive.

            WORD            : Ambidextrous
            BREAKDOWN       : ambi(both) + dexter(LATIN ROOT for right hand)
                              literally meaning "both hands are right hands"!!!
            PART OF SPEECH  : ADJECTIVE
            MEANING         : A person who can use both hands with equal skill. 
        
                   While "left handed person" has always been associated with negativity and awkwardness.
I mean literally the english word "sinister"  meaning  evil , actually comes from the LATIN ROOT "SINISTER"
for left hand. When  the FRENCH word  GAUCHE  meaning "left hand" was adopted in english, it wasn't exactly
showered with complimenting meaning either:
            WORD            : Gauche
            BREAKDOWN       : Gauche (FRENCH ROOT)

                              I cannot stand his gaucherie anymore. [using meaning 2]
