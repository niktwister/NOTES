AUTOMATIC SEMICOLON INSERTION
-----------------------------
    https://www.bradoncode.com/blog/2015/08/26/javascript-semi-colon-insertion/


    We have an option in JS to not put a (;) at the end of a statement even if its grammar rule requires 
    you to do so. For example ,
            var a			same as , 	    var a;
            b = 23						    b = 23;

    The compiler will automatically insert a semicolon there (not literally though!). Compiler not gonna change 
    your source code , it will just pretend as if that location contains a (;).

    This whole drama is just so that JS can distinguish one statement from another , and it sometimes leads to 
    unexpected behaviour.

    There are 3 rules and 2 overriding exceptions that governs its working.

    NOTE :  A Token is the smallest element of a program that is meaningful to the compiler( keywords , 
            identifiers , constants , special symbols , operators ).

            Example of a grammar rule :
            Grammar rule for return statement looks like:  return [no LineTerminator] <exp>;


    RULE 1
    ------
        When reading tokens of a program from left to right , a token that doesn’t match a grammar rule 
        has a semicolon inserted before it if either of the following conditions are met :
            1. The error token is separated from the previous token , by at least one line terminator.
            2. The error token is }.

    
        (1) basically means that if the first token on the next line appears to be in continuation of the 
        grammar rule from the current line , then (;) will not be inserted .If not , then it will be 
        inserted. 

        Example , 		var a 			becomes,			var a;
                        var b						    	var b
        (;) is inserted on line 1 because "var a var" wouldn’t be in continuation of the grammar rule for 
        variable declaration of line 1. 


        Example,		var a 			same as ,			var a = 3 ;
                        =
                        3
        No (;) was inserted on line 1 or line 2 because they all seem to be in continuation of the grammar 
        rule for variable declaration of line 1.



        Example for (2) condition ,
                {return 3}			will become ,		{return 3;}
        The grammar rule for the return statement was expecting a (;) after 3 , but instead it got }.  Hence 
        } becomes the error token and a (;) was inserted before it.


    RULE 2
    ------
        If the program is parsed until the end of the input (meaning that we have reached the end of file) 
        and it is not yet a complete program , then a (;) is inserted at the end of file.

        Example , suppose test.js consist of following two lines only :
            var a = 3;
            a++

        Then a (;) will automatically be inserted at the EOF if required , in order to complete the program :
            var a = 3;
            a++;

        NOTE :  Please note that only the statement whose grammar rule requires a (;) for termination is 
                affected by ASI :-
                empty	    	variable declaration	expression		do-while
                continue		break					return			throw

        Statements like if , while , for , do not require termination by (;) in their grammar rule , and 
        hence are unaffected by ASI.


    RULE 3
    ------
        For the following grammar rules that do not allow line terminators where indicated , if a line 
        terminator is encountered , parser will try to save you by adding a semicolon before the first 
        encountered line terminator.

            Postfix expression:
	            LHSExpression [no LineTerminator] ++
	            LHSExpression [no LineTerminator] --

            Continue statement :
	            continue [no LineTerminator] identifier;

            Break statement :
                break [no LineTerminator] identifier;

            Return statement :
                return [no LineTerminator] <exp>;

            Arrow functions :
                arrowParameters [no LineTerminator] =>  conciseBody

        Example , 

            return 			will become , 			return ;
            {									{
                a: 23									a: 23
            }									}



        Example ,

            a				will become , 			a ;
            ++			    						++c ;
            c


    TWO EXCEPTIONS THAT OVERRIDE THE ABOVE RULES
    --------------------------------------------

        1)  A (;) is never inserted automatically inside the header of a for statement.

                for(expression   ;   expression   ;   expression)
            
                        These two semicolons have to be inserted manually and are
                        also compulsory . ASI won’t work inside the header of for.

        2) A (;) is never automatically inserted if doing so results in an empty statement.

                Example , 

                suppose last line of our program is this ,
                        for(var i=0 ; i < 10 ; ++i)

                Then according to rule #2 , a (;) should have been inserted after it , in order to 
                complete the program. But since doing so would result in an empty statement ,
                hence JS won’t do it , thus resulting in an error.
