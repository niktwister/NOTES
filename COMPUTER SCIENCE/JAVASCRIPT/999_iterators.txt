ITERABLES AND ITERATORS
-----------------------

    Many objects behave like collections. For example, Array objects are collection of same type of elements,
    String objects are collections of characters, Map objects are collection of <key,value> pairs.

    JS support iterable protocol, which if implemented by a collection-like object, will allow us to
    easily iterate through its items. Such objects that implements the iterable protocol are called
    iterables.

    To implement iterable protocol, object should have a method corresponding to a predfined special symbol
    key [Symbol.iterator] . And this method must return an iterator object, that will allow us to access 
    items in the iterable one by one.

    The iterator object will have a method called next(). Every time next() is called on iterator object , 
    it must provide us a new item from the iterable until we have exhausted through all the items in 
    iterable.

    Technically, the next() method returns an object with two properties :
        1)  value   :   item from iterable. Value will become undefined once we have exhausted through
                        all the items.
        2)  done    :   [true/false] Tells us wheter we are done iterating through all the items of 
                        iterable or not.

    Array objects, String objects, Map objects, and Set objects are some built-in iterables :

        >>  let arr = [10,20,30,40]
        >>  let itr = arr[Symbol.iterator]()
        >>  iter.next()
            {value: 10, done: false}
        >>  iter.next()
            {value: 20, done: false}
        >>  iter.next()
            {value: 30, done: false}
        >>  iter.next()
            {value: 40, done: false}
        >>  iter.next()
            {value: undefined, done: true}
        >>  iter.next()
            {value: undefined, done: true}

    
    lets create a custom iterator object :

        >>  let customItr = {
                begin   :   10,
                end     :   13,
                next    :   function(){
                                if(this.begin <= this.end)
                                    return {value : this.begin++ , done : false};
                                else
                                    return {value : undefined , done : true};
                }
        }
        
        //  notice how customItr remembers its positions in sequence by incrementing the 'begin' property
        //  everytime the next() is called , until 'begin' property's value become same as 'end' property's
        //  value.

        >>  customItr.next()
            {value: 10, done: false}
        >>  customItr.next()
            {value: 11, done: false}
        >>  customItr.next()
            {value: 12, done: false}
        >>  customItr.next()
            {value: 13, done: false}
        >>  customItr.next()
            {value: undefined, done: true}

    Now lets use the above custom iterator object to create our custom iterable object called 'range' :

        >>  let range = {
                lowerBound : 10,
                upperBound : 13,
                [Symbol.iterator] : function(){
                    return {
                        begin   :   this.lowerBound,    
                        end     :   this.upperBound,
                        next    :   function(){
                                        if(this.begin <= this.end)
                                            return {value : this.begin++ , done : false};
                                        else
                                            return {value : undefined , done : true};
                        }
                    };
                }
            }

        >>  let rangeItr = range[Symbol.iterator]()
        >>  rangeItr.next()
            {value: 10, done: false}
        >>  rangeItr.next()
            {value: 11, done: false}
        >>  rangeItr.next()
            {value: 12, done: false}
        >>  rangeItr.next()
            {value: 13, done: false}
        >>  rangeItr.next()
            {value: undefined, done: true}
