Two types of comments in JS :

    //  this is  a single line comment

    /*  this is a multiline
        comment     */


Identifiers can begin with either an ‘_’ , ‘$’ , or a letter. The subsequent characters can be letters , 
digits , ‘$’ , ‘_’ .

Many reserved words can’t be used as names for variables , constants , function or classes. But can be used 
as a property within an object. (like : if / else / while / do / for / function / switch / class / …)
    >> let obj = {};
    >> obj.if = 23;     // OK

Reserved words scenario is a little complicated in JS . For eg: "let" is allowed to be used as an identifier 
when declared with "var" , but not allowed when declared with "const" or inside a class. 

    >> var let = 23 ;  // OK   // it is allowed because of backward compatibility issue
