An interface declaration introduces a new reference type whose members are classes, interfaces, constants, 
and methods. 

This type has no instance variables, and typically declares one or more abstract methods; otherwise 
unrelated classes can implement the interface by providing implementations for its abstract methods. 
**Interfaces may not be directly instantiated.

An interface may be declared to be a direct extension of one or more other interfaces (multiple inheritance), 
meaning that it inherits all the member classes and interfaces, instance methods, and static fields of the 
interfaces it extends, except for any members that it may override or hide.

Unlike a class, an interface cannot be declared "final". However, an interface may be declared "sealed" to 
limit its subclasses and subinterfaces.

superinterfaces of a class
--------------------------
    https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.1.5

    A class may be declared to directly implement one or more interfaces. Such interfaces will be called
    the direct superinterfaces of the class.

    An interface I is a superinterface of class C if any of the following is true:

        ->  I is a direct superinterface of C.

        ->  C has some direct superinterface J for which I is a superinterface.

        ->  I is a superinterface of the direct superclass of C.

    A class is said to directly implement its direct superinterfaces, and to implement all of its 
    superinterfaces.

    A class is said to be a direct subclass of its direct superinterfaces, and a subclass of all of its 
    superinterfaces.

    The optional "implements" clause in a class declaration specifies the direct superinterface types of the 
    class being declared. syntax for implementing interface(s) :

        class classname [extends superclass] [implements interface [,interface...]] {
            // class-body
        }


    Unless the class being declared is abstract, all the abstract member methods of each direct superinterface 
    must be implemented either by a declaration in this class or by an existing method declaration inherited 
    from the direct superclass or a direct superinterface, because a class that is not abstract is not 
    permitted to have abstract methods.

    Each default method of a superinterface of the class may optionally be overridden by a method in the class; 
    if not, the default method is typically inherited and its behavior is as specified by its default body.

    It is permitted for a single method declaration in a class to implement methods of more than one 
    superinterface.



A variable whose declared type is an interface type may have as its value a reference to any instance of a 
class which implements the specified interface. It is not sufficient that the class happen to implement all 
the abstract methods of the interface; the class or one of its superclasses must actually be declared to 
implement the interface, or else the class is not considered to implement the interface.


A simplified general form of an interface :

    access interface name{
        type varname1 = value1;
        type varname2 = value2;
        ...
        type varnameN = valueN;

        return-type method-name1(parameter-list);
        return-type method-name2(parameter-list);
        ...
        return-type method-nameN(parameter-list);
    }



superinterfaces and subinterfaces
---------------------------------
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.1.3

    If an extends clause is provided, then the interface being declared extends each of the specified interface 
    types and therefore inherits the member classes, member interfaces, instance methods, and static fields of 
    each of those interface types.

    The specified interface types are the direct superinterface types of the interface being declared.

    Any class that implements the declared interface is also considered to implement all the interfaces that 
    this interface extends.

    An interface I is a superinterface of interface K if either of the following is true:

        ->  I is a direct superinterface of K.

        ->  Where J is a direct superinterface of K, I is a superinterface of J, applying this definition 
            recursively.

    An interface is said to be a direct subinterface of its direct superinterface, and a subinterface of each 
    of its superinterfaces.

    While every class is an extension of class Object, there is no single interface of which all interfaces 
    are extensions.


Interface members
-----------------
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.2

    The members of an interface type are:

        ->  Members declared in the body of the interface.

        ->  Members inherited from any direct superinterfaces.

    
    The interface inherits, from the interfaces it extends, all members of those interfaces, except for 
    (i) fields, classes, and interfaces that it hides, 
    (ii) abstract methods and default methods that it overrides, 
    (iii) private methods, and 
    (iv) static methods.



fields (constants) declaration
------------------------------
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.3

    Every field declaration in the body of an interface is implicitly public, static, and final. It is permitted
    to redundantly specify any or all of these modifiers for such fields.

    Every declarator in a field declaration of an interface must have a variable initializer, or a compile-time
    error occurs.

    The initializer need not be a constant expression. At run time, the initializer is evaluated and the field 
    assignment performed exactly once, when the interface is initialized .

    If the interface declares a field with a certain name, then the declaration of that field is said to hide 
    any and all accessible declarations of fields with the same name in superinterfaces of the interface.

    NOTE : 
        It is possible for an interface to inherit more than one field with the same name. Such a situation 
        does not in itself cause a compile-time error. However, any attempt within the body of the interface to 
        refer to any such field by its simple name will result in a compile-time error, because such a reference 
        is ambiguous. (CHECK EXAMPLE BELOW)

    NOTE :
        There might be several paths by which the same field declaration might be inherited from an interface. 
        In such a situation, the field is considered to be inherited only once, and it may be referred to by 
        its simple name without ambiguity. (CHECK EXAMPLE BELOW)

    
    EXAMPLE : (AMBIGUOUS INHERITED FIELDS)
    --------------------------------------

        interface BaseColors {
            int RED = 1, GREEN = 2, BLUE = 4;
        }

        interface RainbowColors extends BaseColors {
            int YELLOW = 3, ORANGE = 5, INDIGO = 6, VIOLET = 7;
        }

        interface PrintColors extends BaseColors {
            int YELLOW = 8, CYAN = 16, MAGENTA = 32;
        }

        interface LotsOfColors extends RainbowColors, PrintColors {
            int FUCHSIA = 17, VERMILION = 43, CHARTREUSE = RED+90;
        }

        /*  the interface LotsOfColors inherits two fields named YELLOW. This is all right as long as the 
            interface does not contain any reference by simple name to the field YELLOW.

            Even if interface PrintColors were to give the value 3 to YELLOW rather than the value 8, a 
            reference to field YELLOW within interface LotsOfColors would still be considered ambiguous.
        */

        /*  If a single field is inherited multiple times from the same interface because, for example, both 
            this interface and one of this interface's direct superinterfaces extend the interface that 
            declares the field, then only a single member results. This situation does not in itself cause a 
            compile-time error.

            In the previous example, the fields RED, GREEN, and BLUE are inherited by interface LotsOfColors in
            more than one way, through interface RainbowColors and also through interface PrintColors, but the 
            reference to field RED in interface LotsOfColors is not considered ambiguous because only one actual
            declaration of the field RED is involved.
        */


method declaration
------------------
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.4

    A method in the body of an interface declaration may be declared public or private. If no access modifier 
    is given, the method is implicitly public. It is permitted, but discouraged as a matter of style, to 
    redundantly specify the public modifier for a method declaration in an interface declaration.

    A default method is a method that is declared in an interface with the "default" modifier; its body is 
    always represented by a block. It provides a default implementation for any class that implements the 
    interface without overriding the method. Default methods are distinct from concrete methods, which are 
    declared in classes, and from private interface methods, which are neither inherited nor overridden.

    An interface can declare static methods, which are invoked without reference to a particular object.
    static interface methods are distinct from default methods, abstract interface methods, and non-static 
    private interface methods, all of which are instance methods.

    An interface method lacking a private, default, or static modifier is implicitly abstract. Its body is 
    represented by a semicolon, not a block. It is permitted, but discouraged as a matter of style, to 
    redundantly specify the abstract modifier for such a method declaration.

    NOTE :  It is a compile-time error if a method is declared with more than one of the modifiers "abstract", 
            "default", or "static".

    NOTE :  It is a compile-time error if an interface method declaration that contains the keyword private 
            also contains the keyword abstract or default. It is permitted for an interface method declaration 
            to contain both private and static.
    
    A method in an interface may be generic.


Inheritance and overriding
--------------------------
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.4.1

    An interface I inherits from its direct superinterfaces all abstract and default methods m for which 
    all of the following are true:

        ->  m is a member of a direct superinterface, J, of I.

        ->  No method declared in I has a signature that is a subsignature of the signature 
            of m.

        ->  There exists no method m' that is a member of a direct superinterface, J', of I 
            ( m distinct from m', J distinct from J' ),  such that m' overrides from J' the 
            declaration of the method m. (CHECK EXAMPLE BELOW)


    The third clause above basically prevents a subinterface from re-inheriting a method that has already 
    been overridden by another of its superinterfaces. For example, in this program:

        interface Top {
            default String name() { return "unnamed"; }
        }
        interface Left extends Top {
            default String name() { return getClass().getName(); }
        }
        interface Right extends Top {}

        interface Bottom extends Left, Right {}

        /*  Right inherits name() from Top, but Bottom inherits name() from Left, not Right. This is 
            because name() from Left overrides the declaration of name() in Top.
        */

    An interface does not inherit private or static methods from its superinterfaces.

    NOTE :  If an interface I declares a private or static method m, and the signature of m is a subsignature 
            of a public instance method m' in a superinterface type of I, and m' would otherwise be accessible 
            to code in I, then a compile-time error occurs.

    
    Overriding (by Instance Methods)
    --------------------------------

        An instance method mI, declared in or inherited by an interface I, overrides from I another instance 
        method, mJ, declared in interface J, iff all of the following are true:

            ->  I is a subinterface of J.

            ->  I does not inherit mJ.

            ->  The signature of mI is a subsignature of the signature of mJ as a member of the supertype of I 
                that names J.

            ->  mJ is public.

    Requirements in overriding
    --------------------------
        https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.4.1.2

        https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.8.3

        There are some requirements that must be fulfilled when overriding a method. For example consider 
        "access modifier" of the overriding method. We cannot give any "access modifier" to the overriding
        method , it will depend upon the "access modifier" of the overriden method as follows :

            ->  If the overridden or hidden method is public, then the overriding or hiding method must be 
                public; otherwise, a compile-time error occurs.

            ->  If the overridden or hidden method is protected, then the overriding or hiding method must be 
                protected or public; otherwise, a compile-time error occurs.

            ->  If the overridden or hidden method has package access, then the overriding or hiding method 
                must not be private; otherwise, a compile-time error occurs.


Interface Method Body
---------------------

    A default method has a block body. This block of code provides an implementation of the method in the event 
    that a class implements the interface but does not provide its own implementation of the method.

    A private or static interface method also has a block body, which provides the implementation of the method.

    It is a compile-time error if an interface method declaration is abstract (explicitly or implicitly) and has
    a block for its body.

    It is a compile-time error if an interface method declaration is default, private, or static, and has a 
    semicolon for its body.



Member Class and Interface Declarations
---------------------------------------
    https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.5

    An interface body may contain declarations of member classes and member interfaces.
    
    Every member class or interface declaration in the body of an interface declaration is implicitly public 
    and static. It is permitted to redundantly specify either or both of these modifiers.

    It is a compile-time error if a member class or interface declaration in an interface has the modifier 
    protected or private.

    If an interface declares a member class or interface with a certain name, then the declaration of the 
    member class or interface is said to hide any and all accessible declarations of member classes and 
    interface with the same name in superinterfaces of the interface.

    An interface inherits from its direct superinterfaces all the member classes and interfaces of the direct 
    superinterfaces that are not hidden by a declaration in the interface.

    It is possible for an interface to inherit more than one member class or interface with the same name. 
    Such a situation does not in itself cause a compile-time error. However, any attempt within the body of 
    the interface to refer to any such member class or interface by its simple name will result in a compile-
    time error, because the reference is ambiguous.

    There might be several paths by which the same member class or interface declaration is inherited from an 
    interface. In such a situation, the member class or interface is considered to be inherited only once, and 
    it may be referred to by its simple name without ambiguity.
