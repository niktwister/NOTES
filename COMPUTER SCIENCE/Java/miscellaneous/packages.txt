Suppose we want to create a package called "animal.mammal" , and inside this package we want to place a class 
called "Dog".

The first line of Labrador.java should be a package statement as follows :


package animal.mammal;
                                                //after this we can define the Dog class
public class Dog{

    public void speak(){
        System.out.println("bhau bhau");
    }

}



compile Dog.java :     >> javac  -d . Dog.java      // assuming Dog.java is in the 
                                                    // current directory and we want to
                                                    // generate the package in  current
                                                    // directory as well.


The compiler will generate the Dog class's class file and will place it in a directory structure reflecting 
its package heirarchy :

                    animal/
                    |
                    ----- mammal/
                          |
                          ----- Dog.class


We will say that the fully qualified name of Dog class is :     animal.mammal.Dog



We can use this class in our source file using its fully qualified name. For example in order to create 
an object of Dog class we would have to write something like ,
    
    animal.mammal.Dog dog = new animal.mammal.Dog();

When looking for the class file Dog.class , the compiler as well as jvm will look for  animal/mammal/Dog.class
rather than just Dog.class, therefore the immediate directory of animal/ folder should one of the classpath(s)
rather than the immediate directory of Dog.class class file.


import statement
----------------
    Since classes  within packages must  be  fully qualified  with their package name or names , it  could 
    become tedious to type in the long  dot-separated package path  name for every  class you want to use. 
    For this reason , Java includes the  import statement  to  bring certain classes , or entire packages, 
    into visibility. Once imported, a class can be referred to directly, using only its name. For example,

    import animal.mammal.Dog;
    //...
    //...
    //...
    Dog = new Dog();

    Please note that the import statement is a convenience to the programmer and is not technically needed 
    to write a complete Java program.

    The import statement must come immediately after package statement (if it exists) and before any class
    definitions.


    Let us suppose that package "animal" was expanded with new classes and sub-packages as follows :

                                    animal/
                                    |
                                    ----- mammal/
                                    |     |
                                    |     ----- Dog.class                          animal.mammal.Dog
                                    |     |
                                    |     ----- Cat.class                          animal.mammal.Cat
                                    |     |
                                    |     ----- primate/
                                    |           |
                                    |           ----- Monkey.class                 animal.mammal.primate.Monkey
                                    |
                                    ----- amphibian/
                                          |
                                          ----- Frog.class                         animal.amphibian.Frog
    

    import animal.mammal.*;

            The above import statement will import all the top level types (class/interface) in  the  
    animal.mammal package , but the types in sub-packages of animal.mammal will not be imported i.e., 
    IT DOES NOT WORK RECURSIVELY.  
    Therefore Dog and Cat classes will be imported since they are the top level types of animal.mammal
    package , but Monkey class will not be imported since it is in a sub-package.  


NOTE :  It must be emphasized that the import statement is optional. Any place you use a class name, you can
        use its fully qualified name,  which includes its full package hierarchy.  For example, this fragment 
        uses an import statement:

        import java.util.*;
        class MyDate extends Date {
        }

        The same example without the import statement looks like this:

        class MyDate extends java.util.Date {
        }


FACT : All of the standard Java SE classes included with Java begin with the name java. The basic language
       functions are stored in a package called java.lang. Normally , you have to import every package  or 
       class that you want to use, but since Java is useless without much of the functionality in java.lang,
       it is implicitly imported by the compiler for all programs. This is equivalent to the following line
       being at the top of all of your programs:

       import java.lang.*;
