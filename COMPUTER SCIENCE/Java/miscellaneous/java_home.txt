JAVA_HOME is a system environment variable that represents the JDK installation directory.

The JAVA_HOME environment variable is not actually used by the locally installed Java runtime. Instead, other 
programs installed on a desktop computer that require a Java runtime will query the OS for the JAVA_HOME 
variable to find out where the runtime is installed. After the location of the JDK installation is found, those 
programs can initiate Java-based processes, start Java virtual machines and use command line utilities such as 
the Java archive utility or the Java compiler, both of which are packaged inside the Java installation's \bin directory.


Programs that require the JAVA_HOME variable to be configured properly include:

Eclipse, NetBeans and Android Studio
Apache Tomcat
Maven and ANT
Gradle and Groovy
Jenkins
