declaring objects
-----------------

Obtaining objects of a class is a two-step process. First, you must declare a variable of the class type.
This variable does not define an object. Instead, it is simply a variable that can refer to an object. 
Second, you must acquire an actual, physical copy of the object and assign it to that variable. You can do 
this using the "new" operator. The "new" operator dynamically allocates (that is, allocates at run time) memory 
for an object and returns a reference to it. This reference is, essentially, the address in memory of the 
object allocated by "new". This reference is then stored in the variable.

Syntax :

classname class-var;
class-var = new classname( );

OR ,

classname class-var = new classname();

Example , 

    Box mybox = new Box();

    The above statement is these two statements combined : 

        Box mybox;
                                     ------
                                    |      |
                                    |      |
                                     ------
                                     mybox 

        mybox = new Box();
                                     ------
                                    |   ___|________             -----------
                                    |      |       |            |Width      |
                                     ------        |            |-----------|
                                     mybox         |            |Height     |
                                                    --------->  |-----------|
                                                                |Depth      |
                                                                 -----------
                                                                 <Box object>



NOTE : When you assign one object reference variable to another object reference variable, you are not creating
       a copy of the object, you are only making a copy of the reference.

       Example , 

            Box b1 = new Box();
                                        ---------                   -------------
                                        |       |                   |Width      |
                                        |       |------------       |-----------|
                                        ---------           |       |Height     |
                                           b1               |       |-----------|
                                                            ------->|Depth      |
                                                                    -------------
                                                                     <Box object>

            b2 = b1;
                                        ---------                   -------------
                                        |       |                   |Width      |
                                        |       |------------------>|-----------|
                                        ---------                   |Height     |
                                           b1                       |-----------|
                                        ---------           ------->|Depth      |
                                        |       |           |       -------------
                                        |       |------------        <Box object>
                                        ---------
                                            b2



default values 
--------------
https://www.artima.com/articles/object-initialization-in-java (1998)
At the beginning of an object's life, the Java virtual machine (JVM) allocates enough memory on the heap to 
accommodate the object's instance variables. When that memory is first allocated, however, the data it contains 
is unpredictable. If the memory were used as is, the behavior of the object would also be unpredictable. 
To guard against such a scenario, Java makes certain that memory is initialized, at least to predictable 
default values, before it is used by any code.

If you provide no explicit initialization to instance variables, they will be awarded predictable default 
initial values, which are based only on the type of the variable.

                                TYPE                DEFAULT VALUE
                                ----                -------------
                                boolean             false
                                numerical type      0
                                char                \u0000
                                object reference    null

These are the default initial values for both instance and class variables. Local variables are not given 
default initial values. They must be initialized explicitly before they are used.

Note that this means that if we explicitly initialize a field, then when each object is created, that field 
will, in effect, be initialized twice. First, field will be given its default initial value based on its type. 
Later, the default initial value will be overwritten with the proper initial value explicitly provided. All of 
this takes place while the Java virtual machine is creating the new object -- before it returns the reference 
to the new object -- before the constructors are called.
