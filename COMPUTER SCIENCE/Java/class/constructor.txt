constructor
-----------

A constructor initializes an object immediately upon creation. It has the same name as the class in which it
resides and is syntactically similar to a method. 

Once defined, the constructor is automatically called when the object is created, before the new operator 
completes. 
 
We do not explicitly write the return-type for a constructor. The implicit return type of a class’ constructor
is the class type itself. 


class-var = new classname( );       //Here we are calling the constructor of the class that takes no parameter.


default constructor for classes
-------------------------------

If we haven't explicitly defined ANY constructor for the class , then java will automatically create 
a default constructor.

<access-modifier same as class>     classname(){
    super();
}
