final variable
--------------
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.12.4

A class field can be declared as final. Doing so prevents its contents from being modified, making it, 
essentially, a constant. This means that it must be given some value. We can either :
    ->  give it a value when it is declared. OR ,
    ->  give it a value inside the constructor.

and once a value is given , it cannot be modified.


A local variable or a method parameter can also be declared as final. We don't necessarily have to provide a 
value at declaration. Just know that once it is provided ( and it must be provided ) , it cannot be modified 
again. Example ,

    import java.util.Scanner;

    public class Tester{
        public static void main(String[] args){

            final int x;

            Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

            x = sc.nextInt();       // providing value once to x. 
                                    // cannot provide value to x again.

        }
    }



final methods 
-------------

    A method can be declared final to prevent subclasses from overriding or hiding it.

    It is a compile-time error to attempt to override or hide a final method.


final classes
-------------

    A class can be declared final if its definition is complete and no subclasses are desired or required , 
    which means that a final class cannot be inherited.

    Declaring a class as final implicitly declares all of its methods as final, too.

    It is a compile-time error if a class is declared both final and abstract. 
    REASON: An abstract only serves a meaningful purpose if it has subclasses that overrides its abstract
            methods. But a final class can never have a subclass , the methods of a final class can never be
            overriden. Hence it wouldn't make sense to declare a class as both abstract and final.
