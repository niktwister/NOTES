A class field can be declared as final. Doing so prevents its contents from being modified, making it, 
essentially, a constant. This means that it must be given some value. We can either :
    ->  give it a value when it is declared. OR ,
    ->  give it a value inside the constructor.

and once a value is given , it cannot be modified.


A local variable or a method parameter can also be declared as final. We don't necessarily have to provide a 
value at declaration. Just know that once it is provided ( and it must be provided ) , it cannot be modified 
again. Example ,

    import java.util.Scanner;

    public class Tester{
        public static void main(String[] args){

            final int x;

            Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

            x = sc.nextInt();       // providing value once to x. 
                                    // cannot provide value to x again.

        }
    }
