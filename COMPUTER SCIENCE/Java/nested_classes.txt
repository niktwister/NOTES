constant variable ?
    A constant variable is a final variable of primitive type or type String that is initialized with a 
    constant expression.

blank final ?
    A blank final is a final variable whose declaration lacks an initializer.

effectively final ?             
    https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.12.4
    Certain variables that are not declared final are instead considered effectively final:

    A local variable whose declarator has an initializer is effectively final if all of the following are true:
        ->  It is not declared final.
        ->  It never occurs as the left hand side in an assignment expression. (Note that the local variable 
            declarator containing the initializer is not an assignment expression.)
        ->  It never occurs as the operand of a prefix or postfix increment or decrement operator.

    A local variable whose declarator lacks an initializer is effectively final if all of the following are true:
        ->  It is not declared final.
        ->  Whenever it occurs as the left hand side in an assignment expression, it is definitely unassigned 
            and not definitely assigned before the assignment; that is, it is definitely unassigned and not 
            definitely assigned after the right hand side of the assignment expression.
        ->  It never occurs as the operand of a prefix or postfix increment or decrement operator.

    A method, constructor, lambda, or exception parameter is treated, for the purpose of determining whether it 
    is effectively final, as a local variable whose declarator has an initializer.

    If a variable is effectively final, adding the final modifier to its declaration will not introduce any 
    compile-time errors. Conversely, a local variable or parameter that is declared final in a valid program 
    becomes effectively final if the final modifier is removed.

An inner class is a nested class that is not explicitly or implicitly declared static.

An inner class may be a non-static member class , a local class , or an anonymous class.  A member class of an 
interface is implicitly static so is never considered to be an inner class.

It is a compile-time error if an inner class declares a static initializer.

It is a compile-time error if an inner class declares a member that is explicitly or implicitly static, unless 
the member is a constant variable.

An inner class may inherit static members that are not constant variables even though it cannot declare them.
A nested class that is not an inner class may declare static members freely, in accordance with the usual rules 
of the Java programming language. Example :

    class HasStatic {
        static int j = 100;
    }
    class Outer {
        class Inner extends HasStatic {
            static final int x = 3;  // OK: constant variable
            static int y = 4;  // Compile-time error: an inner class
        }
        static class NestedButNotInner{
            static int z = 5;    // OK: not an inner class
        }

        interface NeverInner {}  // Interfaces are never inner , this will throw compile-time error
    }


An instance of an inner class I whose declaration occurs in a static context has no lexically enclosing 
instances. However, if I is immediately declared within a static method or static initializer then I does 
have an enclosing block, which is the innermost block statement lexically enclosing the declaration of I.

When an inner class (whose declaration does not occur in a static context) refers to an instance variable that 
is a member of a lexically enclosing type declaration, the variable of the corresponding lexically enclosing 
instance is used.

Any local variable, formal parameter, or exception parameter used but not declared in an inner class must 
either be declared final or be effectively final , or a compile-time error occurs where the use is attempted.

Any local variable used but not declared in an inner class must be definitely assigned before the body of the 
inner class, or a compile-time error occurs.

A blank final field of a lexically enclosing type declaration may not be assigned within an inner class, or a 
compile-time error occurs.
